TypeScript / React Router Notes app: https://typescript-reactrouter-note-app.netlify.app/

[Simple app built using React.ts to demonstrate functional use of TypeScript, the React Router, Bootstrap components, several react hooks, and passing props through multiple pages for declarations to work throughout the project.]


Use the buttons and forms on screen to create new notes, search notes by title or tags. The "Edit Tags" button will open a modal window to allow you to change the content of notes you have created, or simply remove them entirely. I've kept the design relatively simplified to allow the focus of this app to demonstrate functional use of TypeScript, React Router, Bootstrap elements, and various react hooks.
